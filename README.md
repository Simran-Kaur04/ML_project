* Deploying ML Models using Flask & Heroku 🚀

* Containerization with Docker 🐳

* Handling Data Processing & Feature Engineering 📊

📝 Problem Statement

Given a dataset containing student information with features like gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and test preparation course, the objective is to build a model that predicts a student's math score. This can help identify students who may need additional academic support based on their demographic and educational background.
